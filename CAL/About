Computer Architectural Language (or CAL) has been designed provide a satisfying
markup language for computer architecture. It is assumed that by using this
language, you have experience in systems architecture.

Like a traditional object oriented programming language, this one is organized
into individual code 'blocks' called operations, and interfaces called modules.
Operations contain code for single functions, such as 'MATH', which only
has one function. Interfaces, on the other hand, have multiple functions which
relate to a core function, for instance, in the 'MEMORY_MANAGEMENT' module,
there are multiple operations which all relate to memory management.

Throughout the code, you'll find the means for defining both R and NR objects
are similar to how I write comments, I only did this for ease of reading, so
please don't get them confused.

This is not a programming language! It is simply a method of designing Computer
systems.

If you have any questions, or would like to collaborate, please send me an email
at Nicholasmeins@gmail.com. Please note that whilst I am happy to answer any
questions regarding the use of this language, I will be releasing a full manual
following the first complete release of the language. As such, any information
I provide beforehand may not be of use by the time the manual is released.
